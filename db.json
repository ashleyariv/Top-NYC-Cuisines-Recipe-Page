            "steps":[
                "3 tablespoons flour: whole wheat, all-purpose, or gluten-free blend all work",
                "1 tablespoon ground chili powder",
                "1 teaspoon ground cumin",
                "½ teaspoon garlic powder",
                "¼ teaspoon dried oregano",
                "¼ teaspoon salt, to taste",
                "Pinch of cinnamon",
                "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
                "2 tablespoons tomato paste",
                "2 cups vegetable broth",
                "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus additional for garnish",
                "1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar",
                "5 big handfuls (5 ounces) corn tortilla chips, or homemade crispy baked tortilla chips (see post)",
                "⅓ cup crumbled Cotija, queso fresco or feta cheese",
                "1 small handful (about 3 tablespoons) very thinly sliced radish, or chopped red or green onion",
                "1 ripe avocado, thinly sliced, or guacamole",
                "Optional: 4 fried eggs or scrambled eggs or poached eggs",
                "1 small lime, cut into wedges",

                "1. To make the sauce: Measure the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and cinnamon into a small bowl. Place the bowl near the stove with the tomato paste and broth.",
                "2. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the oil until it is it is hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple of minutes. Keep an eye on it.",
                "3. Once it is ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps.",
                "4. Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and your spoon encounters some resistance as you stir it.",
                "5. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting. Whisk in the cilantro and vinegar and season to taste with additional salt, if necessary (I usually add another pinch or two).",
                "6. To make the chilaquiles: Add the tortilla chips to the skillet. Using a flexible spatula, gently toss until all of the chips are coated in sauce. It might seem like they never will be, but keep stirring!",
                "7. Once coated, remove the skillet from the heat. Test a chip to see if it has softened to your liking (this is really a matter of personal preference—I like my chips lightly tender). If the chips are not sufficiently softened, cover the skillet for 1 to 4 minutes, until you are happy with their texture.",
                "8. Sprinkle the chilaquiles generously with crumbled cheese, radish and cilantro leaves. Scoop servings onto individual plates, add a few slices of avocado, a fried egg if desired, and a wedge of lime. The chips will continue softening with time, so chilaquiles are best served promptly (do not re-cover the pan to preserve heat; the chips will get far too soggy)."
